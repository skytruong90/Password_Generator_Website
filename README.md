# Password Generator Website

## Project Overview

The Password Generator Website is a simple, user-friendly web application that allows users to generate strong and secure passwords. The application gives users the flexibility to customize the length of the password and include or exclude uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols according to their security needs.
